Thotcon 0x5 badges.

Basics:
* Replace ARDUINO_ROOT/hardware/arduino/variants/leonardo/pins_arduino.h with libraries/pins_arduino.h (back up the existing one)
* Replace ARDUINO_ROOT/hardware/arduino/boards.txt with the one from this repo.
* To program via USB, you need the actual Leonardo or LilyPadUSB bootloader.  To install that, you'll need to use some kind of AVRISP.  This is a good place to start: http://letsmakerobots.com/content/make-arduino-isp-programmer

More:
* The schematics are under hardware/development/iss_p1/release
