    -- Add 5 volt tolerance for compatibility with 5 volt Arduino
       shields.

    -- Implement high speed USB. We already have USB connection means.
       There appears to be area available opposite the USB connector
       side of the PC board.

    -- Undoubtedly, the antenna/feedline arragement could be tweaked/
       imporved. An accurate planar 3D simulation should be able to
       identify refinements. 150 foot range was obtained with a P2
       prototype. How much more performance could be gained is unclear.
