Project: "Thotcon0x5 Badge Project" - An electric name tag.

Customer: Workshop 88, Inc.

Client: Thotcon 0x5 Organizing Committee.

NOTES:

   1.  Please advise ASAP as to the suitability of the enclosed
       files, particularly the centroid file (thotcon_0x5-all.pos),
       should any file conversions be required.
       
   2.  A quantity of parts sufficient to assemble a minimum of 850
       units will be delivered for assembly.
       
       Over-runs, scrap, and leftover material must be returned.

   3.  Manufacture each of the following colors as follows:

        SOLDER MASK         SILKSCREEN        Quantity
   
     * Gloss "gold"           BLACK           8 minimum
     * Gloss red              BLACK          40   "
       Gloss blue             WHITE          40   "
       Gloss green            WHITE         128   "
       Flat black             WHITE         608   "
                                            ____________
                              GRAND TOTAL   824 minimum

     * A piece of white tape must be placed on the bottom of the
       displays installed in the gold and red boards ONLY.

   4.  DS1 - Glass display:
   
       a.  Manufacturer logos & RoHS stickers, if present, must be
           removed prior to assembly. Failure to do so is a visual
           DEFECT. (Clear plastic covering may be left in place.)
           
       b.  Glass display DS1 must be fixtured such that the under-
           side of the display is spaced .04" - .07" above the PCB
           surface.  Failure to do so is a DEFECT that will leave
           the displays susceptible to mechanical and thermal stress
           and breakage.

   5.  There are a several unused components on each assembly. These
       components are designated "DO NOT PLACE" or "P/O PCB" on the
       bill of material. Holes for unplaced though hole components
       must remain free of solder.

   6.  Battery holders must be positioned with opening (cutout) as
       shown on the silkscreen.
       
   7.  Build the GOLD and RED panels FIRST. Use ALL gold and red
       panels. Build the GREEN and BLUE panels next. Use up ALL green
       and blue panels. Run the BLACK panels LAST, as these panels
       are the most numerous, and shortfalls here can be accommodated
       more readily.
       
   8.  Finished goods must be packaged in a manner sufficient to
       protect against ESD hazards & breakage of the (glass) display
       unit. Antistat bags or antistat bubble wrap are acceptable.
       Like colors must be packaged or grouped together. 
       
   9.  Customer will install batteries and program units.

  10.  Completed units and other materials, as noted in (3) will be
       retrieved by the customer (or his agent) at the Elk Grove
       Village location.
