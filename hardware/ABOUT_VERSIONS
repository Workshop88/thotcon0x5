     INTRODUCTION

     The use of dates for version control did not communicate PCB project
     status concisely, so the following PCB revision nomenclature has been
     adopted.

     Revision Format:

        PART_NUMBER             STATUS            NUMBER      PATCH_LETTER

         <varied>        [ X | T | P | A - Z ]   [ 1 -  ]       [ a - ]


     Explanation:

     PART_NUMBER:
                   Various.

     STATUS:
              X:
                   An experimental release, solely for research and
                   marketing previews. Effectively a breadboard.

              T:
                   A tooling release, intended for early-stage test
                   and evaluation. May be used to generate preliminary
                   costing and to secure preliminary bids/quotes. May
                   not be feature complete, or fully functional.

              P:
                   A prototype release, which is essentially a feature
                   freeze. "P" intended for product development and
                   testing, the production of drawings for tooling,
                   (such as PC boards, housings, etc.) and for vendor
                   qualification.

              A-Z:
                   A design released to manufacturing for volume 
                   production. It is expected to meet all require-
                   ments. Products at this status do not have a
                   revision number or a patch letter. Feature
                   changes or product modifications require an "up-
                   issue" to the next consecutive revision lettter.
                   The letters X, T, and P may not be reused for
                   shipping products. Revisions  beyond "Z" will
                   use a two letter "AA" "BB" "CC" sequence.

       NUMBER:
                   A number starting from 1, indicating a minor version
                   "bump" to an X,  T, or P status part or assembly,
                   that is less than a new design. Revision number field
                   is not to be used for shipping products.

       
       PATCH_LETTER:
                   Patch letters start with lower case "a" and proceed
                   consecutively. Patch letters are to be used for "teeny"
                   modifications to X, T, and P revisions (part substi-
                   tutions for example), that do not warrant a full version
                   bump. Patch letters are not to be used with shipping
                   products.
