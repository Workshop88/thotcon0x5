bmp2glcd - Bitmap to GLCD bitmap ver 1.01 by S.Varjo 2008

To create binary file simply invoke make. 

Usage: bmp2glcd <image.bmp> <options>
	-h <height>	target image height in pixels
	-w <width>	target image width in pixels
	-v	verbose mode
	-pgm	create header with __attribute__ ((progmem)) for AVR
	-pic30  create header whith __attribute__((space(auto_psv))) for PIC30
	-glcdlib create header for use with Arduino glcd library

This program converts a bitmap to binary bitmap (black and white) with 8bit page
height that can be written directly to graphical lcd display. A c-header file is
created where data bytes represent pixels in page columns rather than in lines.
The created bitmap is solely to see the result image in a simple way.
